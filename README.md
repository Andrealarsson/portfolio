# portfolio

I have start to build my very own portfolio based on Technigo design guidelines with my projects so far and some information about me and my contact details.

Requirements:

ðŸ”µ Blue level

    The page should be built with HTML and CSS (JS if needed)
    You should use flexbox for layout (you can use CSS grid if you're comfortable with that).
    The page should be fully responsive. (mobile, tablet and desktop)
    The page should look and function the same on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
    The page should work well for people that use screen readers and keyboard navigation.
    The HTML code should validate in a validation tool.

This was a fun project that I will have a lot of use of in the future. The most difficult thing is to plan at the beginning of the week. I start by dividing all the sections and worked from top to bottom. But the last day I always think I could have planned better and come up with a better structure, better names of the classes and so on but time is running out. 
I will continue working with my portfolio and make it even better!
